# Graphql

The graphql endpoint(s) that we use are proxied by Apollo Studio so that we have one
endpoint and the possebility to add multiple sub graphs.

## getting the newest schema

To fetch the newest schema file you have to authenticate with Apollo Studio,
this can be done with the Rover CLI. Run `rover config auth`, or set `$APOLLO_KEY`
to a valid Apollo Studio API key.

Admin rights can be acquired through Thijs van Diessen.
